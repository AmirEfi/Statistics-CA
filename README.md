## Computer Assignments in Engineering Probability and Statistics course - Fall 2021

This repository is for my all computer assignments (except the first one because I couldn't complete it on time) in Statistics course.

They are short and simple codes in python.

The questions of HW3 are in this [link](https://github.com/SBU-CE/CE004-Statistics/tree/main/Homeworks/CA-3).

And the questions of HW2 are clear in the notebook.
